Write a program in C# to accept two numbers as command line arguments and display all the prime numbers between the given two numbers. 
If the first number is greater than the second then the numbers are displayed in descending order otherwise they are displayed in ascending order.
Eg if the args are 3 and 20 , the program should display
5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
Eg if the args are 20 and 3 , the program should display
19, 17, … 5
